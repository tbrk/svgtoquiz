The source image can be downloaded from:

    (This image is (in part or entirely) based on geographical data from
     Statistics Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek). It was
     created by Mtcv)

The individual images and export file were automatically generated using a
script: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tbourke/software/svgtoquiz.html

The Wikimedia Commons original was edited to group paths by province and to
update the ids and labels with Dutch province names.

The background colour was changed by running:
    sed 's/fill:#ffd6c0/fill:#fdf9d2/' Provinces_of_the_Netherlands.svg \
	> output.svg

To create the 'Netherlands: Provinces' cards:
    svgtoquiz --name=Netherlands-Provinces \
	      --category='Netherlands: Provinces' \
	      --group=0 --zoom=2 Provinces_of_the_Netherlands.svg

These cards use a newer feature of svgtoquiz that respects the group
hierarchy (--group=0) in svg files.

Then import form:
    ~/.mnemosyne/maps/Netherlands-Provinces/Netherlands-Provinces.xml

The png files were reduced in size by converting them to indexed format:
    for f in *.png; do convert -colors 256 $f $f.png && mv $f.png $f; done

The card set zip file was created by running:
    (cd $HOME/.mnemosyne && \
     find maps/Netherlands-Provinces -type f \
	| zip $OLDPWD/Netherlands-Provinces -@)

NB: Names are in Dutch. Some of the provinces have different names in English:
	Noord-Holland	    North Holland
	Zuid-Holland	    South Holland
	Noord-Brabant	    North Brabant
	Zeeland		    Zealand
