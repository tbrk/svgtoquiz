The card contents were originally created by:

Any comments or suggestions regarding the Mnemosyne version should be
directed to Timothy Bourke <timbob@bigpond.com>.

The questions and answers were converted from the Javascript into
French-IPA-Vowels.csv. The graphic was recreated in svg format.

The card set was created using the multiple-choice feature of svgtoquiz:
    svgtoquiz --multiple-choice \
	      --svgtopng=inkscape --zoom=0.6 --id-regex='box(\d\d)' \
	      --category='French: IPA Vowels' French-IPA-Vowels.svg

The card set zip file was created by running:
    (cd $HOME/.mnemosyne && \
     find maps/French-IPA-Vowels -type f \
     | zip $OLDPWD/French-IPA-Vowels -@)

Note:
    An alternative to generating the question and answer table from an svg
    image would be to create it as an html table. The card set produced
    would be smaller and more flexible (able to scale to the window size,
    for instance), but a unicode font with the IPA symbols would be
    required at the client side.
