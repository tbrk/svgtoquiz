The land colour was changed to match Map_of_USA.svg. A blue background was
added.

The Africa.csv file was created by running:
    svgtoquiz --zoom=0.5 --gui-csv-edit Africa.svg
German names were replaced with their equivalents in English.

Run:
svgtoquiz --zoom=.4 --randomize --match-csv Africa

Then import form:
    ~/.mnemosyne/maps/Africa/Africa.xml

NB:
* Most of the smaller island nations and territories are not included.
* Only one of the Sao Tome & Principe islands is highlighted due to
  limitations in the svgtoquiz script.
