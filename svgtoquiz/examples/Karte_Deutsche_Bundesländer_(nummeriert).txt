The individual images and export file were automatically generated using a
script: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tbourke/software/svgtoquiz.html

The numbers in the original map were removed in Inkscape.

The background colour was changed by running:
    sed 's/fill="#b1d1a3"/fill="#fdf9d2"/' \
	Karte_Deutsche_Bundesl채nder_(nummeriert).svg \
	> output.svg

To create the 'Germany: States' cards, a csv file was first created by
running and manually editing the names:
    svgtoquiz --gui-csv-edit --zoom=.5 \
	      Karte_Deutsche_Bundesl채nder_(nummeriert).svg

Then svgtoquiz was run again to create the card set:
    svgtoquiz --name=Germany-States \
	      --category='Germany: States' \
	      --zoom=.7 Karte_Deutsche_Bundesl채nder_(nummeriert).svg

These commands must be run in a unicode compatible terminal. If rsvg has a
problem with the unicode filenames, try inkscape: --svgtopng=inkscape

Then import form:
    ~/.mnemosyne/maps/Germany-States/Germany-States.xml

The png files were reduced in size by converting them to indexed format:
    for f in *.png; do convert -colors 256 $f $f.png && mv $f.png $f; done

The card set zip file was created by running:
    (cd $HOME/.mnemosyne && \
     find maps/Germany-States -type f \
	| zip $OLDPWD/Germany-States -@)

NB: Names are in German but English names are given in brackets.
