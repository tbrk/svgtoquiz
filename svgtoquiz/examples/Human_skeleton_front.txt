The individual images and export file were automatically generated using a
script: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tbourke/software/svgtoquiz.html

The Wikimedia Commons original was edited to restructure the layers and
groups, and to add ids and labels for the named bones.

The labels and background were removed by running:
    xsltproc --novalid --stringparam layers 'layer1|layer4' \
	removelayers.xsl Human_skeleton_front.svg \
	> outputs.svg

The Human_skeleton_front.svg file was created by running:
    xqilla -i Human_skeleton_front.svg inkscapeids.xql | \
	egrep -v "(layer|Right)" | sort > Human_skeleton_front.csv

To create the 'Human skeleton: from front' cards:
    svgtoquiz --name=Skeleton-Human_front \
	      --category="Skeleton: Human front" \
	      --match-csv --csv-path=Human_skeleton_front.csv \
	      --enter-group="layer3|FootLeft|HandLeft|Skull" \
	      --zoom=.5 outputs.svg

These cards use a new feature of svgtoquiz 1.5.0 that allows descent through
some groups and not others to be specified with regular expressions. It is
less coarse than the --groups=<num> option.

The image is quite long and thus use requires either at least 800 vertical
pixesls or the answer overlay patch (available from the author, but
submitted for inclusion in mnemosyne).

Then import form:
    ~/.mnemosyne/maps/Skeleton-Human_front/Skeleton-Human_front.xml

The png files were reduced in size by converting them to indexed format:
    for f in *.png; do convert -colors 256 $f $f.png && mv $f.png $f; done

The card set zip file was created by running:
    (cd $HOME/.mnemosyne && \
     find maps/Skeleton-Human_front -type f \
	| zip $OLDPWD/Skeleton-Human_front -@)
