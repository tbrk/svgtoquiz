* Package up with Dist tools (maybe using the egg system).
* Improve support for use on Windows.
* Create subdirectories inside ~/.mnemosyne/maps by default.
* Add a feature for grouping multiple paths (e.g. islands)
* Try harder to discover paths for rsvg and inkscape.
* Write a man page (generate a pdf version for windows).
* Improve i18n support (at the moment, the script assumes that all incoming
  bytes, like command-line arguments and csv files, are in utf-8, it should
  probably better respect locale settings).
  

Enhancements
------------
* Add more options for parsing svg files.
  (handle groups, objects other than paths)
